I need a powerpoint presentation that shows how AI can improve the SDLC process.  That presents the following with visuals as well as text:
* Different phases in the SDLC
* Roles for each phases. Limit to:
   * Business Analyst
   * Business Stakeholder
   * Product Owner
   * Solution Architect
   * Tech Lead
   * UI/UX Designer
   * Software Engineer in Test
   * QA Engineer
   * DevOps or platform Engineer
* Tools used by roles in each phases. Limit it to:
   * Atlassian Jira, Confluence
   * VSCode
   * GitHub Copilot
   * Figma
   * Terraform
   * Lucid chart

Highlight the following as well:
* MCP servers, how they help
* Streamlining workflows
   * Identify what still needs to be manual work per phase. for example reviewing output from AI but be more specific per role
* How having standardization of documentation etc and feeding more context to AI will help
