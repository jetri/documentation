- Bypassing code review processes for AI-generated changes
- Using Copilot for regulated systems without compliance approval

❌ **Data Sovereignty Violations**:
- Processing classified or export-controlled information
- Using Copilot for systems requiring guaranteed data residency
- Sharing code from repositories marked as RESTRICTED

## 4. MCP Server Governance and Approved Catalog

### Using Approved MCP Servers
Our on-premises Kubernetes cluster hosts a **curated catalog of MCP servers** that extend Copilot's capabilities while maintaining security. Developers can freely use any server from the approved catalog.

**Currently Approved MCP Servers**:
| Server Name | Purpose | Access Level |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| `docs-reader` | Internal documentation search | Read-only |
| `jira-assistant` | Issue tracking integration | Read-only |
| `confluence-kb` | Knowledge base access | Read-only |
| `github-enterprise` | Extended repository context | Read-write with approval |
| `slack-search` | Communication history | Read-only |

### Requesting New MCP Servers
To add a new MCP server to our catalog:
1. **Submit request** via the AI-Tools ServiceNow portal
2. **Security review** completed within 3 business days
3. **Automated deployment** upon approval to our Kubernetes cluster
4. **Immediate availability** to all authorized developers

### MCP Security Controls
All MCP servers in our environment **automatically include**:
- **OAuth 2.1 authentication** with PKCE and corporate SSO integration
- **Network isolation** with no direct internet access
- **Comprehensive audit logging** of all interactions
- **Automatic secret redaction** before any external calls
- **Resource limits** preventing runaway processes

## 5. Code Execution Safety Measures

### Mandatory Safeguards
**All AI-generated code must pass through**:
- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline (blocks on HIGH/CRITICAL findings)
- **Secret detection** with GitGuardian (prevents commits with exposed credentials)
- **Human review** via standard pull request process
- **SAST analysis** using GitHub Advanced Security

### Safe Execution Practices
When testing AI-generated code:
- **Use designated sandbox environments** with network isolation
- **Never execute untested code** with production credentials
- **Leverage E2B sandboxes** for potentially destructive operations
- **Monitor resource consumption** during initial executions

### Destructive Code Prevention
Our infrastructure **automatically prevents**:
- Direct production deployments of AI-generated code
- Execution of system-level commands without approval
- Database write operations in development environments
- Network calls to unauthorized external services

## 6. Data Protection and Sovereignty Requirements

### Strict Data Sovereignty Compliance
**Critical Requirement**: All code and data must remain within our infrastructure. GitHub Copilot processes data in Microsoft Azure regions, which meets our sovereignty needs through:

- **Content Exclusion**: Repositories marked with `SOVEREIGNTY-REQUIRED` tag are automatically excluded from Copilot processing
- **Local MCP Processing**: All MCP servers run on our premises, ensuring context data never leaves our infrastructure
- **No Training Guarantee**: GitHub contractually guarantees our code is never used for model training
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all Copilot interactions for compliance verification

### Configuration Requirements
**Mandatory Settings** (automatically enforced):
- Content exclusion for `/secrets/`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, `/customer-data/` paths
- Code matching filter enabled to detect public code similarities
- Telemetry collection disabled for Business tier
- Chat history retained for only 28 days

### Handling Sensitive Projects
For projects with heightened security requirements:
1. **Mark repositories** with appropriate classification tags
2. **Use local development** with Copilot disabled for CLASSIFIED projects
3. **Enable additional scanning** for financial and healthcare systems
4. **Document AI usage** in compliance reports as required
